# 2. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:

# Run ifconfig, get only line with "broadcast", get sixth word on line.
echo "a) Identify broadcast address"
ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | awk '{print $NF}'

echo "b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet"
# The netmask on the same line tells us the size of the subnet. 0xffffff00 means 255.255.255.0
# That means there are 256 addresses in the subnet: x.x.x.0 to x.x.x.255
# If subnet mask is 0xffff0000 then it means 255.255.0.0, which would mean there are 256*256 = 65546 addresses from x.x.0.0 to x.x.255.255.
