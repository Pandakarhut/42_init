# 15. Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# The DNS entries in /etc/hosts are always evaluated first.
# If we add intra.42.fr and 46.19.122.85 there, the computer will always connect to 46.19.112.85 when trying to get to intra.42.fr
# We can use vim to append one more line to /etc/hosts:
# sudo vim /etc/hosts
# Then add line: 46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr
# And save file
