# 16. Find the service which makes it possible to run specific tasks following a regular schedule
cron

# The cron service lets you choose what commands are automatically run at which times of the day, or on which days.
# A plain cron installation in Debian runs the daily cron job at 06:25, the weekly ones at 06:47 and the monthly ones at 06:52.
# The crons are stored in /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.monthly etc.
# There is also /etc/crontab where you can define days, hours and minutes you want to run specific commands.
