# 17. Find the command that allows you to connect via ssh on the VM. (In parallel with the graphic session)
ssh -X user@host

# If the VM is running with an IP 192.168.1.15 (for example) and there is a user "john" created on the debian VM, then user@host is john@192.168.1.15
# The server would ask for the users password then, before letting him login.
